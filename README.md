CS499 - Hackathon 1


1, Team members: Khanh Nguyen, Miraj Patel


2, Github URL:
https://github.com/LongPotato/s3-filesync


3, GET ALL URL:
https://54.244.204.248:8080/list

## Important!

We are using https for the end point. You need to "approve" the route first before you can
access via the front-end website.
On Chrome:
* Enter the GET ALL URL into the the url bar.
* Enter
* It will show you that the website is not safe.
* Go to advance > Proceed.
Now you can use the url with the front end client.
